# Assembler

This repository represents my contribution to a larger project submitted to the open univeristy, as fulfillment of the requirements for the System Programming Laboratory course.
The project emulates the operation of an assembler, converting code from a programming language to machine language, in a two-pass assembly process.
My contribution performs the first pass, that parses the code, searches for errors and converts the information to binary representation adhering to pre-set rules.
